After sketching with pencil and paper I moved onto a digital sketch and an animatic. After being satisfied with a system several code experiments were created in flash to find and deal with all possible fringe cases. With fringe cases dealt with an xml file containing what I considered home, far I was from home and how many photos I took on any particular day was parsed and visualized using the flash script previously mentioned. Several more experiments ensued to weed out more issues previously undiscovered and to look for the best way to display the data. Upon finding a satisfactory solution, I ported the generated graphic to Illustrator where I applied visual aids and typography to make a pleasing graphic.</p><div class="images tritty"><img src="img/9monthsRaster.png" class=full alt="A section of an infographic detailing travel"></div></article><article><img class=icon src="img/Marathon1.png" alt="Boston Marathon App icon"><h2>Boston Marathon</h2><p>Created in about three weeks this application tied into the Boston Globe branding of the Boston Marathon while utilizing an under documented alpha version of jQuery Mobile. I specifically did all design and development except pulling in the RSS and Twitter feeds (which I now know how to do). The map integration was originally designed show any queried runner's location but the BAA refused to share information. As a result it was redesigned to show people's geotagged #marathon tweets's locations. Unfortunately, after looking at datasets for the Boston area an insignificant number of users geotagged their tweets so the idea was put aside. The web application was used approximately 76,000 times over the Marathon weekend.</p><div class=appWrapper><iframe src="http://marathon.frandias.com" frameborder=0></iframe></div><img class=marginbump src="img/MarathonIntro.png"></article><article><img class=icon src="img/Instrument.png" alt="Scooter instrument panel icon"><h2>Instrument Pannels</h2><p class=shorttext>In Asia a very popular mode of transportation (especially in Vietnam) is to travel by scooter. I noticed that the instrument panels on each bike differed. I felt like this was an under appreciated design so I began taking photos, cataloging features and re-illustrating them for a blog</p><div class="images fitty"><img src="img/InstrumentDolphin.png" alt="Dolphin Instrument Panel"><img src="img/InstrumentBlue.png" alt=""></div></article></section><section id=development class=skill data-roll=development><h1><em>Development</em></h1><article><img class=icon src="img/Choropleth.png" alt="Icon of a choropleth map showing unemployment"><h2>Choropleth</h2><p>A tutorial on making the same choropleth map in several languages (JavaScript with and without D3, Processing, R and Python). The tutorial is targeted at designers who maybe familiar with one language and are nervous to try another. The talk, if accepted, is for the open vis conference and touches on data accessibility, proper use and abuses of information design. During the talk I will be specifically using Choropleth maps to make a point about the visualization of electoral votes during the past election. You can see where I am in the <a href="https://github.com/FranDias/Choropleth-for-designers">Python</a> section on Github.</p><div class=images><img src="img/ChoroplethBig.png" width=700 alt="raster render of the above listed coce generating a cholorpleth map of the US"></div></article><article><img class=icon src="img/Atari.png" alt="Raster rendering of a CSS Atari logo icon"><h2>Atari</h2><p class=shorttext>This Atari logo got on the front page of Hacker News and <a href="http://cssdeck.com/labs/animated-atari-logo"> CSS Deck</a> received approximately 8,000 views within a day of release.
